# Efficient_matrix_multiplication
This a lab from Chip Design using High-level: HLS_accelerating is to speed up matrix multiplication economically in high level synthesis, with the help of rearrangement of multiplication order and strategies like unrolling, pipelining or array_partition (using Vitis HLS); And FPGA_accelerating is to add more optimizations with respect to interface and data struct (using Vitis HLS and Vivado).

The target is to increase speed and conserve resources and more detailed demands are included in Readme.md respectively.
